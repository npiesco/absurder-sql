# VaultApp Privacy Policy (Draft)

Effective date: 2026-02-11

## Overview
VaultApp is designed as a local-first password manager. Core vault data is stored on your device.

## Data We Store
- Credential entries you create (names, usernames, passwords, notes, TOTP secrets).
- App settings (theme, security preferences, auto-lock options).

## Data Sharing
- VaultApp does not require an account for local vault usage.
- Vault data is not uploaded by default.
- Export/import only occurs when explicitly initiated by you.

## Security
- Vault data is encrypted at rest.
- Access is protected by master password and optional biometric unlock.

## Your Choices
- You can export backups and delete local data from the app/device.
- You can disable biometric unlock and adjust security settings.

## Contact
For support and privacy questions, use the project support channel/repository owner contact.

## Notes
This draft must be reviewed and finalized before public store submission.
