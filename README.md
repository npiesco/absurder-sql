# SQLite IndexedDB Rust Library

## Overview

This project is a Rust library that provides SQLite database functionality in web browsers by implementing a Virtual File System (VFS) that persists data to IndexedDB. The library compiles to WebAssembly (WASM) and offers both Rust and JavaScript APIs for running SQL queries with persistent storage in browser environments. It bridges the gap between traditional SQLite databases and browser-based storage, enabling full SQL capabilities with IndexedDB as the underlying storage mechanism.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**VFS Layer**: Implements a custom SQLite Virtual File System that translates SQLite's file operations to IndexedDB operations. This allows SQLite to work seamlessly with browser storage without modifications to the core SQLite engine.

**Storage Abstraction**: Provides a unified interface for different storage backends, with IndexedDB as the primary target. The design allows for future expansion to other storage mechanisms while maintaining API compatibility.

**WASM Bridge**: Handles the interface between Rust code and JavaScript, managing memory allocation, type conversions, and async operation bridging. This ensures smooth interoperability between the WASM module and browser JavaScript.

**Type System**: Defines comprehensive data structures for SQL operations, query results, and configuration options, ensuring type safety across the Rust-JavaScript boundary.

### Frontend Architecture
The web demo uses vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap for styling, demonstrating real-time SQL query execution and result visualization. The frontend architecture emphasizes simplicity and direct WASM integration without complex frameworks.

### Data Storage Design
**Primary Storage**: IndexedDB serves as the persistent storage layer, chosen for its transaction support, large storage capacity, and widespread browser compatibility.

**Memory Management**: The library implements careful memory management for WASM operations, ensuring proper cleanup of allocated memory and efficient data transfer between Rust and JavaScript contexts.

**Transaction Handling**: Leverages SQLite's transaction capabilities while ensuring proper coordination with IndexedDB's transaction model for data consistency.

### Configuration System
The architecture supports configurable database options including cache size, synchronization modes, and VFS-specific settings, allowing optimization for different use cases and performance requirements.

## External Dependencies

### Rust Dependencies
- **rusqlite**: Primary SQLite interface for Rust, providing safe bindings to SQLite C library
- **wasm-bindgen**: Facilitates communication between Rust and JavaScript in WASM context
- **js-sys**: Provides bindings to JavaScript's built-in objects and functions
- **web-sys**: Offers bindings to Web APIs including IndexedDB
- **serde**: Handles serialization/deserialization for data exchange
- **tokio**: Provides async runtime support for handling asynchronous operations

### JavaScript Dependencies
- **Bootstrap 5.1.3**: UI framework for responsive design and component styling
- **Feather Icons**: Icon library for user interface elements

### Browser APIs
- **IndexedDB**: Primary storage API for persistent data storage
- **WebAssembly**: Runtime environment for executing the compiled Rust code
- **Fetch API**: Used for loading WASM modules and handling HTTP requests

### Development Tools
