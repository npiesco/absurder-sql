## Open (in order)

1. [ ] VFS Write Buffering Performance Optimization
   - [x] VFS successfully integrated with IndexedDB backend
   - [x] Database persistence working correctly
   - [x] Read performance competitive (1.5ms vs 1.4ms absurd-sql)
   - [x] Write performance issue identified (32ms vs 5.9ms absurd-sql for inserts)
   - [x] Root cause: synchronous writes to GLOBAL_STORAGE on every x_write call
   - [x] Researched absurd-sql's approach (analyzed source code and blog post)
   - [ ] **Key insight from absurd-sql**: Use long-lived IndexedDB transactions
     - Keep a single `readwrite` transaction open during SQLite write operations
     - Buffer all writes in the transaction (don't commit on every write)
     - Only commit when SQLite calls `xSync` (fsync equivalent)
     - This leverages IndexedDB's transactional semantics for atomic commits
     - Eliminates need for journal files (can use `journal_mode=MEMORY`)
   - [ ] Implementation plan:
     1. Modify `x_write` to buffer writes in memory (don't persist to GLOBAL_STORAGE immediately)
     2. Open long-lived IndexedDB transaction on first write in a transaction
     3. Keep transaction alive using `Atomics.wait` pattern (blocks event loop)
     4. Flush buffered writes to IndexedDB transaction in batch
     5. Only commit IndexedDB transaction when `x_sync` is called
     6. Reuse transactions across multiple SQLite operations for massive speedup
   - [ ] Implement buffered write strategy in VFS layer
   - [ ] Add transaction lifecycle management (open/keep-alive/commit)
   - [ ] Benchmark after optimization to match absurd-sql performance

2. [x] Crash Consistency & Atomic Batching (Native + IndexedDB)
   - [x] Native (fs_persist): detailed logging around sync/commit/recovery (implemented with tests)
   - [x] WASM/native-test: read visibility gated by commit marker in `read_block_sync()`; checksum verification only for committed data
   - [x] IndexedDB: transactional writes {blocks + metadata} with commit marker (5/5 tests passing)
   - [x] IndexedDB: recovery scans to finalize/rollback (5/5 tests passing)
   - [x] Idempotent writes keyed by (block_id, version) (6/6 tests passing)
   - [x] Tests: simulate crash mid-commit; recovery correctness (native fs_persist)
   - [x] Tests: simulate crash mid-commit; recovery correctness (IndexedDB)

3. [x] Multi-Tab Single-Writer
   - [x] Leader election (localStorage + atomic coordination with lease lock & expiry)
   - [x] Deterministic leader selection (lowest instance ID wins)
   - [x] Lease expiry & re-election (5 second timeout with heartbeat mechanism)
   - [x] Tests: basic coordination, lease handover, multiple instances (4/4 tests passing)

4. [x] Observability
   - [x] Metrics: dirty_count, dirty_bytes, throughput, error_rate, checksum_failures
   - [x] Events/callbacks: on_sync_start/success/failure; backpressure signals
   - [x] WASM sync_count tracking fix: proper cross-platform observability integration

5. [x] WASM AutoSync Manager
   - [x] Event-driven architecture (requestIdleCallback, visibility change, beforeunload)
   - [x] Threshold-based syncing via maybe_auto_sync()
   - [x] Comprehensive test suite (8/8 tests passing in headless Chrome)

6. [x] VFS Durability Mapping
   - [x] Implemented `force_sync()` method with durability guarantees (waits for IndexedDB persistence)
   - [x] Fixed IndexedDB database name consistency ("block_storage" across all operations)
   - [x] Fixed IndexedDB version and upgrade handlers (version 2 with proper object store creation)
   - [x] Comprehensive test suite (7/7 tests passing in headless Chrome)

---

## Completed (highlights)

- [x] **VFS Durability Mapping**: Successfully implemented `force_sync()` method providing SQLite VFS xSync durability guarantees. The method ensures all dirty blocks are persisted to IndexedDB and waits for completion before returning. Fixed critical IndexedDB issues: standardized database name to "block_storage" across all operations (was inconsistently using "sqlite_storage"), upgraded to version 2 with proper upgrade handlers that create object stores on first open, and added upgrade handlers to restore_from_indexeddb() function. Created comprehensive test suite (7 tests) covering: basic persistence to IndexedDB, idempotent syncing, commit marker advancement, error handling, waiting for persistence with multiple blocks, and transaction-like durability. All tests pass in headless Chrome. The implementation delegates to the existing sync() infrastructure which already handles IndexedDB persistence properly. Full test matrix green: 77 WASM tests (including 7 new vfs_durability tests) + 62 native tests.
- [x] **Event-Driven WASM AutoSync Manager**: Successfully implemented truly event-driven auto-sync for WASM environments, replacing timer-based approach with browser-native event mechanisms. Uses requestIdleCallback for opportunistic syncing during idle time, visibility change events to sync when tab becomes hidden, and beforeunload events for final sync before page closes. Threshold-based syncing via maybe_auto_sync() triggers async syncs when dirty block count or bytes exceed policy limits. Created comprehensive test suite (8 tests) covering basic enablement, policy configuration, background execution, threshold triggering, metrics tracking, multi-instance coordination, error handling, and shutdown cleanup. All tests pass in headless Chrome. This is a proper event-driven architecture - no polling, no timers, just reactive syncing based on browser events and application state. Full test matrix green: 70 WASM + 62 native + 62 native with fs_persist.
- [x] **Comprehensive Observability Infrastructure**: Successfully implemented production-grade observability features for BlockStorage using strict Test-Driven Development (TDD). Created ObservabilityManager with atomic counters for thread-safe metrics tracking (dirty blocks, sync counts, error counts, checksum failures, throughput, error rate) and comprehensive event callback system (sync lifecycle, error callbacks, backpressure signals). Features cross-platform support with conditional compilation for native vs WASM callback types, real-time throughput calculation, and event-driven architecture. Fixed critical WASM sync_count tracking issue by adding sync_count field to ObservabilityManager and updating get_metrics() to use observability manager instead of conditionally compiled fields. Adapted tests for fs_persist vs non-fs_persist behavioral differences. All observability tests passing: 4/4 metrics tests, 3/3 event callback tests. Full test matrix green: 62 native + 62 WASM tests.
- [x] **Multi-Tab Leader Election**: Implemented robust localStorage-based atomic coordination for multi-tab leader election, resolving race conditions where all instances were becoming leaders simultaneously. Features deterministic leader selection (lowest instance ID wins), atomic leadership claiming with check-and-set logic, lease expiry & re-election (5 second timeout), heartbeat mechanism (1 second intervals), and proper cleanup on instance stop. All 4 leader election tests pass: basic coordination, lease handover, multiple instances, and heartbeat communication. Production-ready with comprehensive logging and error handling.
- [x] Auto Sync Manager (native) extraction: Extract dedicated `AutoSyncManager` from `BlockStorage` (keep `SyncPolicy`/debounce/threshold semantics)
- [x] Native AutoSync with `SyncPolicy` (interval, thresholds, debounce), Tokio + std::thread fallback, and `drain_and_shutdown()`; comprehensive tests passing
- [x] Block metadata persistence: checksum, version, last_modified_ms; read-time verification; algorithm selection (FastHash/CRC32)
- [x] Startup Recovery: corruption detection/repair modes; reconciliation of files vs metadata; atomic commit marker; idempotent runs; crash-hardened fsyncs
- [x] Recovery enhancement: delete invalid-sized `block_*.bin` during reconciliation; fsync `blocks/` dir; tests green
- [x] Crash-consistency tests (native fs_persist): finalize/rollback pending metadata; pending deallocation removes stray file; tombstone persists across finalize â€” all green
- [x] fs_persist sync behavior: do not prune `metadata.json` entries based on allocation set; keep/remove `block_*.bin` strictly per metadata; preserves version/timestamp semantics
- [x] Metadata semantics: same-data writes still bump `version` and `last_modified_ms` for dirty blocks on sync; batch-write tests ensure only touched blocks update
- [x] Full test suites green in default and with `fs_persist`; stabilized tests with TempDir-based `DATASYNC_FS_BASE` and `#[serial]`
- [x] Crash consistency logging (native fs_persist): added tests asserting logs for sync start/success, pending metadata write/finalize, cleanup-only path, alt mirror `(alt)` path when `DATASYNC_FS_BASE` changes, and startup recovery stray cleanup plus summary; all green with/without `fs_persist`
- [x] Test infra: global test logger to capture logs; silenced `dead_code` warnings for helper to keep `-D warnings` builds green
- [x] Allocations.json logging (native fs_persist): info-level logs for allocations.json writes during cleanup-only and dirty sync (primary and `(alt)` mirror paths). Added tests `logs_allocations_write_cleanup_only` and `logs_allocations_write_sync_dirty_alt` in `tests/crash_consistency_logging_tests.rs`. Full suites green with and without `fs_persist`.
- [x] WASM VFS baseline: registered custom VFS name by aliasing default, gated WASM-only imports to avoid unused warnings, and verified native+WASM test suites pass; groundwork laid for IndexedDB-backed VFS methods and transactional semantics.
- [x] Verified WASM commit marker advancement and cross-instance visibility: `BlockStorage::sync_now()` persists blocks/metadata then advances `GLOBAL_COMMIT_MARKER`; `read_block_sync()` gates by metadata version <= marker; `IndexedDBVFS` uses `STORAGE_REGISTRY` to route operations through the gating path.
- [x] **SQLite WASM Hang Issue Resolution**: Completely resolved infinite hang issue in SQLite WASM integration by replacing problematic custom bindings with stable `sqlite-wasm-rs` crate (v0.4 with precompiled features). Root cause was deprecated WASM module initialization parameters causing infinite loops in `sqlite3_step` calls. Implemented comprehensive regression test suite (6 tests) covering operation timeouts, large result sets, concurrent operations, error conditions, and deprecated pattern detection. All 64 WASM tests + 74 native tests now pass without hangs. Production-ready SQLite WASM integration achieved with full C API compatibility, proper memory management, and robust error handling.
- [x] WASM commit-marker gating tests: `wasm_bindgen_test` in `src/storage/block_storage.rs` verifying zeroed reads while marker lags, checksum skip when invisible, and version/marker tracking across syncs; headless Chrome passing.
- [x] fs_persist crash test: mid-commit partial multi-block mixed presence; startup recovery rolls back to prior commit, removes stray files, keeps missing absent (`tests/crash_partial_multi_mixed_presence_tests.rs`).
- [x] **Modular Architecture Transformation**: Successfully extracted 2,023 lines across 5 modules from monolithic `block_storage.rs` (3,085 â†’ 1,168 lines, 62% reduction). Created `io_operations.rs` (622 lines), `sync_operations.rs` (364 lines), `allocation.rs` (235 lines), `constructors.rs` (434 lines), and enhanced existing `recovery.rs` (368 lines). Used dependency injection pattern with proper delegation methods. All 62 native + 62 WASM tests pass with no regressions. Clean separation of concerns: I/O operations, sync logic, block lifecycle, platform constructors, and recovery functionality.
- [x] **IndexedDB Recovery Scans**: Implemented IndexedDB recovery scan functionality with `perform_indexeddb_recovery_scan()` in `wasm_indexeddb.rs`. Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/indexeddb_crash_recovery_tests.rs` (5 tests) covering recovery finalization, rollback simulation, corruption detection, commit marker monotonicity, and multi-database recovery. Recovery scans are integrated into WASM constructor to detect and handle incomplete transactions. All tests pass with proper recovery behavior documented.
- [x] **Idempotent Writes Keyed by (block_id, version)**: Implemented true idempotent writes for IndexedDB using composite keys `"db_name:block_id:version"` instead of `"db_name:block_id"`. This ensures that the same (block_id, version) combination can be written multiple times safely without overwriting committed data. Added comprehensive test suite in `tests/idempotent_writes_tests.rs` (6 tests) covering same-version writes, different-version writes, concurrent writes, checksum consistency, and metadata handling. Fixed conditional compilation issues for proper cross-platform import handling. All test matrix passes: cargo test --features fs_persist, wasm-pack test --chrome --headless, and cargo test.
- [x] **IndexedDB Crash Simulation & Recovery**: Implemented comprehensive crash simulation and recovery testing for IndexedDB. Created `tests/indexeddb_crash_simulation_tests.rs` with 4 tests covering mid-commit crashes, partial block writes, recovery correctness, and concurrent crash scenarios. Added production-grade crash simulation methods `crash_simulation_sync()`, `crash_simulation_partial_sync()`, and `perform_crash_recovery()` to `BlockStorage`. Recovery logic intelligently finalizes transactions when blocks are successfully written to IndexedDB, maintaining data consistency across crashes. Enhanced IndexedDB persistence with detailed logging and proper error handling. All tests pass: 4/4 crash simulation tests, full WASM test suite (62+ tests), and complete native test matrix.
- [x] Full test matrix green: native, native+fs_persist, and WASM (`wasm-pack test --chrome --headless`).
